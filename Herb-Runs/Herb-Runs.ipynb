    "# Modelling herb runs in Old School Runescape\n",
    "\n",
    "## 01-Background\n",
    "Herbs are a type of plant that can be grown in the farming skill in Old School Runescape. Personally I find herb runs (\"runs\" referring to visiting each herb patch around the in-game map once to harvest the crop) perfect for training the farming skill as they are quick and cheap. The availablily of direct teleports to most of the herb patches allows any route to be taken from one patch to another, eliminating the need to determine an optimal route. The purpose of modelling (and perhaps simulating) herb runs is for optimsation of cost per xp as well as improving my basic Python skills (mainly trying to learn numpy, scipy, pandas and matplotlib).\n",
    "\n",
    "Plant growth in Old School Runescape works based off a discrete time system referred to as ticks. Each plant type (herbs, fruit trees, hops... etc.) has a set total growth time for the plant to be ready for harvest. These set growth times are partitioned into different ticks as displayed at <https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Farming#Growth_cycles>. Herbs operate on a tick of 20 minutes between each growth stage until a total of 80 minutes has been reached and the herb is ready to harvest. That is if the herb as not contracted a disease in any of the preceeding growth phases. Herb patches can be treated with three different tiers of compost that increase crop yield and decrease disease chance. These composts also increase the minimum possible amount of herbs that can be harvested from a single herb patch. \n",
    "\n",
    "So a simple simulation of a single herb patch will go like so:\n",
    "0. The player plants a herb seed into a herb patch and treats it with compost. The zeroth growth stage of the herb will last until (any-hour):15, (any-hour):35 or (any-hour):55. So potentially an entire growth phase can be skipped if a herb is planted at (any-hour):14... etc.\n",
    "1. The first growth stage is reached at the same times as specified in the previous step. A random number is generated to check whether the herb contracts a disease. If a disease is contracted the growth cycle will stop on the next farming tick where the plant dies. In this intermediate tick where the herb is diseased but not dead the herb can potentially be treated with a plant cure to cure the disease.\n",
    "2. The second growth stage is reached and the previous step is repeated. \n",
    "3. The third and final growth stage is reached. If the herb has remained free of disease for the whole growth period the herb will stay harvestable indefinitely. \n",
    "4. The player who is on a herb run comes to harvest the fully grown herb. The minimum number of herbs is then harvested plus a variable amount extra. \n",
    "So this process can take a minimum of 61 minutes and a maximum of 80 minutes plus the time the player takes to get there and harvest. \n",
    "\n",
    "In-game there are 9 available herb patches. Some of these patches have extra in-game requirements to unlock. For the purposes of my data collection I only have access to 8 out of 9 herb patches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 02-Theoretical Framework\n",
    "If we define the extra amount of herbs harvested on a single herb patch as a random variable $X$ say, then we can consider modelling it as a negative binomial random variable. As a player continues harvesting extra herbs until the first failure. Each individual harvest of a herb can be treated as a Bernoulli trial with some unknown fixed probability of failure $p$ say. This probability may have different dependenies such as: what type of herb is planted, what the players farming level is, and which of the 9 herb patches the herbs are being harvested from. Hence, this problem requires some sort of method to solve for this unknown probability $p$. Once found we can construct the particular negative binomial distribution in question and do some exploratory simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the collected data to obtain a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of $p$. This corresponds to our best guess based on the collected data. To do so we need to contruct a likelihood function from the known probability mass function of a negative binomial random variable. In general if we let $Y\\sim {NB}(1,p)$ then as listed on <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution>, the probability mass function (PMF) is\n",
    "$$P(Y=y) = \\binom{y+1-1}{y} p^{y}(1-p)^{1} = p^y(1-p).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to consider switching to a likelihood based perspective. If we let $\\theta$ be a guess of $p$ based on the collected data labelled $Y_1=y_1, Y_2=y_2,\\dots Y_n=y_n$ for $n$ observations of extra herbs harvested at one particular patch. Then the probability that the chosen $\\theta$ fits an individual observation is the same as above now with fixed $y_i$ (for $i$ labelling each data-point) in place of fixed $p$\n",
    "$$l(\\theta\\ \\vert \\ Y_i=y_i) = P_{\\theta} (Y_i=y_i) = \\theta^{y_i}(1-\\theta).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which gives the joint probability that the chosen $\\theta$ fits all of the data as the product of all of these individual PMFs (as each number of extra herbs harvested at each patch is independent and identically distributed)\n",
    "$$L\\left(\\theta \\ \\vert \\ Y_1=y_1, Y_2=y_2,\\dots Y_n=y_n\\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\theta^{y_i}(1-\\theta).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the MLE based on our given data we need to maximise the above function in terms of choice of $\\theta$. The $\\theta$ that does so (what we called $p$) will be our best guess. Maximising such a function is quite difficult so we can consider using a log transform to transform the above from a product to a summation. This will have no effect on the $\\theta$ that maximises $L$. We compute the log likelihood by\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned} \n",
    "\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\theta \\ \\vert \\ Y_1=y_1, Y_2=y_2,\\dots Y_n=y_n\\right) &= \\log\\{L\\left(\\theta \\ \\vert \\ Y_1=y_1, Y_2=y_2,\\dots Y_n=y_n\\right)\\} \\\\\n",
    "&= \\log\\left\\{\\prod_{i=1}^n \\theta^{y_i}(1-\\theta)\\right\\} \\\\\n",
    "&= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log\\left\\{\\theta^{y_i}(1-\\theta)\\right\\} \\\\\n",
    "&= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[y_i\\log(\\theta) + \\log(1-\\theta)\\right] \\\\\n",
    "&= \\log(\\theta)\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i + n\\log(1-\\theta).\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We could then consider maximising this log likelihood by the first and second derivative tests or numerically using Python's SciPy package, which inclues an optimisation kit (scipy.optimize). I have chosen to do both so that I can compare the accuracy of the numerical method with the analytic solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find extrema of the above function we take the first derivative and set it to zero such that\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\frac{dL}{d\\theta} &= 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\left[\\log(\\theta)\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i + n\\log(1-\\theta)\\right] &= 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \\frac{n}{1-\\theta} &= 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i &= \\frac{n}{1-\\theta} \\\\\n",
    "(1-\\theta)\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i &= n\\theta \\\\\n",

    "\\theta \\left(n + \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\right) &= \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\\\\n",
    "\\theta &= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i}{n + \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i}.\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for the sake of clarity consider labelling this extrema as $\\vartheta$, we can divide both numerator and denominator of the resulting fraction by $n$ to find a nice expression just in terms of the mean of the data $\\bar{Y}$\n",
    "$$\\vartheta = \\frac{\\bar{Y}}{1+\\bar{Y}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to check the boundary values that $\\theta$ can take as well, as these could also possibly be extrema. As $\\theta$ is a probability it is bounded by $0$ and $1$. Hence, the set of possible extrema for this function is $\\{0,\\vartheta,1\\}$. Next we need to check if each extrema is a maximum or a minimum of the function by the second derivative test. The extrema that is the maximum will be the MLE\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\frac{d^2L}{d\\theta^2} &= \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\left[\\frac{dL}{d\\theta}\\right] \\\\\n",
    "&= \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \\frac{n}{1-\\theta}\\right] \\\\\n",
    "&= -\\frac{1}{\\theta^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \\frac{n}{(1-\\theta)^2}.\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can note that this second derivative is undefined at both $\\theta = 0$ and $\\theta = 1$ due to division by zero. Hence, these values cannot be extrema. That leaves just $0<\\vartheta<1$ to be checked. We can see that for any $\\vartheta$ in its specified range that the second derivative will be negative. So by the second derivative test we find this extrema to be a maximum. Hence, the MLE\n",
    "$$p = \\frac{\\bar{Y}}{1+\\bar{Y}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From this MLE $p$ we can estimate the true in-game probability of failing to pick an extra herb on a particular patch.\n"
