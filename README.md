# my-projects
If you are having trouble viewing my Jupyter Notebooks please view them through [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

This is where I will list my unsorted side projects. 
I will use this directory as a brain-storming ground for further projects.
If one of these projects develops into something more sophisticated I will separate it into its own directory.
In my write-ups I tend to use "we" when refering to steps taken in a problem solving process.
i.e. We can now do this ... etc. Just think of "we" refering to you and I (the reader and I).

## current-ideas
- "Modelling herb runs in Old School Runescape"
I intend to use this as a refresher/intro project for the purposes of learning Python, collecting data and completing some exploratory data analysis.
