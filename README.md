# my-projects
If you are having trouble viewing my Jupyter Notebooks please view them through [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

This is where I will list my unsorted side projects. 
I will use this directory as a brain-storming ground for further projects.
If one of these projects develops into something more sophisticated I will separate it into its own directory.
In my write-ups I tend to use "we" when refering to steps taken in a problem solving process.
i.e. We can now do this ... etc. Just think of "we" refering to you and I (the reader and I).

## current-projects
- ["Plant Seedling Image Classification for Big Data & Analysis"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/overview)
Can you differentiate a weed from a crop seedling?
The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment. The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a dataset containing images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages. We're hosting this dataset as a Kaggle competition in order to give it wider exposure, to give the community an opportunity to experiment with different image recognition techniques, as well to provide a place to cross-pollenate ideas.

## finished-projects
- "Modelling herb runs in Old School Runescape" 
I intend to use this as a refresher/intro project for the purposes of learning Python, collecting data and completing some exploratory data analysis.

- ["Housing Prices Project for Big Data & Analysis"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
