# my-projects
This is where I will list my unsorted side projects. 
I will use this directory as a brain-storming ground for further projects.
If one of these projects develops into something more sophisticated I will separate it into its own directory.

## current-ideas
- "Modelling herb runs in Old School Runescape"
I intend to use this as a refresher/intro project for the purposes of learning Python, collecting data and completing some exploratory data analysis.
